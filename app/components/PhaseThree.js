          <h4>Randomization Procedures</h4>
          <p>Mice were randomly assigned to treatment groups using a computer-generated randomization sequence (R software, version 4.1.2, seed 20230317) with block randomization (block size = 4) to ensure equal group sizes. Animal identification numbers were used for randomization, and group assignments were concealed from investigators during the allocation process. The randomization was performed by a researcher not involved in behavioral testing or data analysis.</p>
          
          <h4>Testing Procedures</h4>
          <p>The order of behavioral testing was randomized across animals using a separate randomization sequence (R software, seed 20230318) to control for time-of-day effects. For the Morris water maze test, starting positions were pseudo-randomized across the four possible positions, with each animal starting from each position once per day, presented in a random order. The randomization of starting positions was generated using a Latin square design to ensure balance.</p>
          
          <h4>Data Analysis</h4>
          <p>Before group assignment was revealed for analysis, outlier detection was performed using pre-established criteria (values exceeding 2.5 standard deviations from the group mean). Three mice were excluded from analysis based on these criteria (one from the vehicle group, two from the 0.1 mg/kg MK-801 group).</p>

          <h4>Randomization of Housing Conditions</h4>
          <p>Upon arrival, rats were randomly allocated to standard housing (SH; n = 18) or environmentally enriched housing (EE; n = 18) using a computer-generated randomization sequence (GraphPad Prism, seed number: 20220614). The randomization was stratified by body weight to ensure similar mean weights across housing conditions at the start of the experiment. The person performing the randomization was different from those conducting behavioral tests and tissue analysis.</p>
          
          <h4>Selection for Testing and Tissue Collection</h4>
          <p>After 30 days, half of the rats from each housing condition were randomly selected for neurochemical assay using a separate randomization sequence (GraphPad Prism, seed number: 20220715). The remaining rats were randomly assigned to a testing order for behavioral assessment using a third randomization sequence, with testing conducted by an investigator blinded to housing conditions.</p>
          
          <h4>Tissue Processing</h4>
          <p>Brain samples were labeled with unique numeric codes to mask housing condition during processing and analysis. The order of tissue processing and MTT assay was randomized using a computer-generated sequence to minimize potential bias from systematic processing effects.</p>

          <h4>Embryo Collection and Allocation</h4>
          <p>Fertilized eggs were collected from 12 breeding pairs to ensure genetic diversity. Eggs were pooled, and those with normal development at 4 hours post-fertilization were randomly allocated to experimental conditions using a computer-generated randomization sequence (Python 3.9, random.shuffle function, seed=20210327). A total of 450 viable embryos were distributed across the three experimental conditions (isolated rearing, normal density, and high density), with 150 embryos per condition.</p>
          
          <h4>Tank Assignment and Positioning</h4>
          <p>For each condition, embryos were randomly assigned to replicate tanks using a balanced approach to ensure equal numbers per tank. The positioning of tanks within the recirculating system was randomized and rotated every three days to control for potential position effects on water quality or light exposure.</p>
          
          <h4>Behavioral Testing and Tissue Collection</h4>
          <p>At 20 dpf, 20 fish from each condition were randomly selected for behavioral testing using a stratified randomization to include fish from all replicate tanks. The order of behavioral testing was randomized, with tests conducted by an experimenter blinded to rearing conditions. The remaining fish were euthanized at 21 dpf, with the order of processing randomized using a computer-generated sequence to prevent systematic biases in tissue preservation quality.</p>
