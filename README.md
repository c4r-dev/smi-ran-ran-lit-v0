# Randomization Reporting in Scientific Research: A Three-Phase Learning Experience

This web application provides a comprehensive educational experience on randomization reporting in scientific research through three interconnected phases. Each phase builds on the knowledge gained in the previous one, guiding users from critical analysis to practical application.

## Learning Objectives

By completing all three phases, users will:

1. Identify common issues and omissions in randomization reporting
2. Apply best practices to improve randomization reporting
3. Compare their improvements to expert revisions
4. Create reusable templates for high-quality randomization reporting
5. Develop skills for both conducting and reviewing research

## Phase 1: Critical Review

In the first phase, users analyze the methods section of a scientific paper to identify issues with randomization reporting.

**Key Activities:**
- Select from three different papers across different research domains
- Review the paper's methods section with a focus on randomization
- Answer guided questions about the adequacy of randomization reporting
- Identify specific missing information that would be needed for replication

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Recognize when randomization is inadequately reported
- Identify specific types of information that should be included
- Understand the relationship between randomization reporting and reproducibility

## Phase 2: Improving Randomization Reporting

Building on the critical analysis from Phase 1, users develop specific improvements to enhance randomization reporting.

**Key Activities:**
- Review best practices for randomization in the specific research domain
- Suggest specific details to add about randomization methods
- Identify additional elements that should be randomized
- Draft an improved randomization paragraph for the methods section
- Prioritize the most important best practices for the specific study

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Apply domain-specific best practices to improve research methods
- Develop practical writing skills for scientific methods reporting
- Prioritize critical elements of randomization reporting

## Phase 3: Application and Reflection

In the final phase, users compare their improvements to expert revisions and reflect on applying these principles to future research.

**Key Activities:**
- Compare self-created improvements with expert revisions
- Analyze specific techniques used in expert randomization reporting
- Reflect on applying lessons learned to their own research
- Create a general-purpose template for randomization reporting

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Recognize high-quality randomization reporting
- Identify specific techniques that enhance clarity and reproducibility
- Develop transferable skills for improving randomization in various research contexts
- Create reusable templates that can be applied to different study types

## Educational Approach

This three-phase approach is designed using principles of experiential learning and scaffolded instruction:

1. **Analysis** (Phase 1) - Critical examination of existing reporting
2. **Application** (Phase 2) - Guided improvement using best practices
3. **Synthesis** (Phase 3) - Comparison with expert examples and creation of transferable knowledge

The application maintains a consistent UI/UX throughout all phases while advancing the cognitive complexity of the tasks. Data is preserved between phases using localStorage, allowing users to reference their previous work.

## Technical Implementation

The application is built using:
- Next.js framework for routing and page structure
- React for interactive components
- Client-side state management for phase progression
- Responsive design for accessibility on various devices
- localStorage for data persistence between phases

## Target Audience

This educational tool is designed for:
- Early-career researchers learning scientific methods
- Research methods instructors teaching reproducibility
- Journal editors and reviewers assessing randomization reporting
- Anyone interested in improving the quality and reproducibility of scientific research

## Future Development Opportunities

Potential enhancements for future versions include:
- Expanded paper library with more research domains
- Customizable difficulty levels
- Peer review functionality
- Downloadable completion certificates
- Server-side storage of responses for longitudinal learning analysis
